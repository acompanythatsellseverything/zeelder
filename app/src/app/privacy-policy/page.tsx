											customers access or visit (but not on which pages
											individual users visit), IP addresses, browser type,
											Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating systems,

											Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to

										</p>
										<p>
											recognize your browser and capture and remember certain

											settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at
											your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify
											your cookie preferences. If you turn cookies off, you will
											not have access to many features that make your Website
											experience more efficient and some of our Services will
											not function properly. We use cookies only to record

											Pixel Tags. In addition, we use <b>“Pixel Tags</b>” (also
											referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
											Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique
											identifier, similar in function to Cookies, which are used
											to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to
											Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive,
											Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags
											also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users
											can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been
											opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that
											are of interest to our users. We may use this information
											to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											Third Party Analytics. We use third party services
											providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how
											users use the Website (“<b>Analytics Providers</b>”).
											Analytics Providers use Cookies to collect information
											such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they
											visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to
											the Website. We use the information we get from Analytics
											Providers only to improve our Website and Services.
											Analytics Providers collect only the IP address assigned
											to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your
											name or other personally identifying information. We do
											not combine the information generated through the use of
											Analytics Providers with your personal data.

								<h1>Privacy and Third-Party Links</h1>

									This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by
									our Website and Services. In an attempt to provide you with
									increased value, we may include third-party links on our
									Website. These linked sites have separate and independent
									privacy policies, and we do not have control over and do not
									review these linked sites. We therefore have no responsibility
									or liability for the content and activities of these linked

								<h1>Do Not Track Signals</h1>
								<p>
									<br />
								</p>
								<p>
									Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the
									websites and other online services with which your web browser
									communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if
									anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.
									We currently do not take action in response to these signals.
									If and when a standard is established, we may revise our
									policy on responding to these signals.
								</p>
